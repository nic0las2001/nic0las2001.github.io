I am a PhD student ([Aerosol Science CDT](https://www.aerosol-cdt.ac.uk/)) and Aerospace Engineering (MEng) graduate from the University of Bristol. I am originally French and moved to the UK for my higher education. At university, I developed highly relevant theoretical and applied engineering knowledge, achieving 'First Class Honours' and maintaining a high average (76%) throughout my degree.

My current PhD research is on "Data-Informed Modelling of Aerosol Resuspension Under Aerodynamic Loads" and is undertaken at the University of Bristol under the supervision of [Dr Alberto Gambaruto](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/alberto-m-gambaruto), [Prof Karen Aplin](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/karen-l-aplin) and [Dr Nick Zang](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/b-zang). 

I am strongly interested in aviation, space and generally the aerospace sector where my current experience and eagerness to learn new skills can make a valuable contribution. I am particularly interested in simulations and modelling and have experience with a broad range of relevant software packages and coding languages.
