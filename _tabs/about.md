Before pursuing a PhD, I obtained the French Baccalaureate at [Ecole Jeannine Manuel](https://www.ecolejeanninemanuel.org.uk/fr/) in Paris. I then completed an undergraduate MEng degree in Aerospace Engineering at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), achieving 'First Class Honours' with an average of 76%. With a strong interest in simulations, modeling, and experience in various software packages and coding languages, I joined the [Aerosol Science CDT](https://www.aerosol-cdt.ac.uk/) in 2023 as a postgraduate researcher in aerosol resuspension.

My current PhD research focuses on "Data-Informed Modelling of Aerosol Resuspension Under Aerodynamic Loads" at the University of Bristol. I am working under the supervision of [Dr Alberto Gambaruto](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/alberto-m-gambaruto), [Prof Karen Aplin](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/karen-l-aplin), and [Dr Nick Zang](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/b-zang). The project aims to investigate the mechanisms behind resuspension, identify key influencing parameters, and develop machine-learning-based semi-empirical models for better prediction. The research involves state-of-the-art experimental and numerical approaches such as wind tunnel testing, CFD simulations, and machine learning models (PINNs).

In addition to my research, I have a strong interest in aviation, aerospace, and the tech sector. My major hobbies include playing tennis, walking, skiing, traveling, and undertaking miscellaneous coding projects like this website!
